# IATA-CODE
IATA 3-letter codes are short codes used to identify airports and cities around the world.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) assigns a unique 3-letter code, commonly referred to as an IATA code, to each airport and major city around the globe. These codes are widely used in aviation and logistics to simplify the identification of locations in travel itineraries, cargo tracking, and other industry-related activities. 

For example, JFK is the IATA code that represents New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport—a code that’s easily recognized by many. However, not all codes are as well-known. Take KUL, for instance—do you know which airport it represents? KUL is the code for Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia.

These IATA codes are invaluable for travelers, airlines, and logistics companies, ensuring that everyone in the industry speaks the same language when it comes to location identification. Below, you’ll find a comprehensive list of IATA codes, organized alphabetically by city names. This list will help you identify the airports and cities associated with each code, making it easier to understand travel documents, plan trips, or even just satisfy your curiosity about global destinations.
